    {"abstract": "This paper describes the design and implementation of a methodology for the visualisation and hypothetical virtual reconstruction of Roman polychrome statuary for research purposes. The methodology is intended as an attempt to move beyond visualisations which are simply believable towards a more physically accurate approach. Accurate representations of polychrome statuary have great potential utility both as a means of illustrating existing interpretations and as a means of testing and revising developing hypotheses. The goal of this methodology is to propose a pipeline which incorporates a high degree of physical accuracy whilst also being practically applicable in a conventional archaeological research setting. The methodology is designed to allow the accurate visualisation of surviving objects and colourants as well as providing reliable methods for the hypothetical reconstruction of elements which no longer survive. The process proposed here is intended to limit the need for specialist recording equipment, utilising existing data and those data which can be collected using widely available technology. It is at present being implemented as part of the 'Statues in Context' project at Herculaneum and will be demonstrated here using the case study of a small area of the head of a painted female statue discovered at Herculaneum in 2006.", "authors": ["Gareth Beale", "Graeme Earl"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["10482dd3-4642-4193-842f-85f3b70fcf65", "3133714c-f979-4d84-9224-97361cf053ab", "3a926fef-7422-4654-8776-8e31b45be563", "52f480e8-85e6-4c01-9e5b-d75eabf6a8ec", "6f52f995-7c4c-4a92-83aa-d1c9fbd2465c", "8bd964d6-c45f-448c-9e65-efe5f98ca0a0", "8fa0a362-6522-48fc-bd5e-24de00ed6511", "9bfa8c24-8fb6-44d9-ba42-38b22f9cf34b", "b57cc9ef-64b6-479d-9918-5f283af3219d", "b678b546-e867-4a57-8963-c5545b04f32d", "e5c40bf5-7ee2-4cff-a75a-b708ab69997b", "f0dccb0c-c17a-4fcb-a89f-fe4bdfa3356d", "fdd93623-31c8-487b-8554-d6c6b25af5f6"], "title": "A methodology for the physically accurate visualisation of roman polychrome statuary", "venue": "visual analytics science and technology", "year": 2011, "id": "001c58d3-26ad-46b3-ab3a-c1e557d16821"},

    {"abstract": "Recent achievements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Psychology invoke the challenges to identify the insight of emotions. In the present study, we have identified different psychology related theme words while analyzing emotions on the interview data of ISEAR (International Survey of Emotion Antecedents and Reactions) research group. Primarily, we have developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to generate visual graphs for analyzing the impact of emotions with respect to different background, behavioral and physiological variables available in the ISEAR dataset. We have discussed some of the interesting results as observed from the generated visual graphs. On the other hand, different text clusters are identified from the interview statements by selecting individual as well as different combinations of the variables. Such textual clusters are used not only for retrieving the psychological theme words but also to classify the theme words into their respective emotion classes. In order to retrieve the psychological theme words from the text clusters, we have developed a rule based baseline system considering unigram based keyword spotting technique. The system has been evaluated based on a Top-n ranking strategy (where n=10, 20 or 30 most frequent theme words). Overall, the system achieves the average F-Scores of .42, .32, .36, .42, .35, .40 and .40 in identifying theme words with respect to Joy, Anger, Disgust, Fear, Guilt, Sadness and Shame emotion classes, respectively.", "authors": ["Ankita Brahmachari", "Priya Singh", "Avdhesh Garg", "Dipankar Das"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["84d47128-58d0-4187-aa44-389fde7d5c83", "e0dce69e-5bb6-4835-a624-066f5cd0420b", "f4b32fa0-8bc6-422b-999c-d2c32e261e1f"], "title": "Identifying Psychological Theme Words from Emotion Annotated Interviews", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "id": "00a119c4-d367-4607-b3c8-b237f2971bff"},

    {"abstract": "Three speech training systems for hearing-impaired children were designed and constructed using a minicomputer and a microprocessor. The first system displays the lateral shape of the vocal tract for each vowel estimated from the speech sound. In this system, three storages are prepared. One of them can be used to store a reference shape which may be estimated from a teacher's voice or a prepared standard shape. A child can articulate seeing the reference shape and re-articulate comparing his own first articulation with the reference shape. The system can also compare the estimated shape with the reference one and produce instructions with animated cartoons which show where any articulatory defects exist. The second system displays successively the lateral shapes for articulation of any phoneme sequences containing consonants. The third system displays the first two formant frequencies extracted from speech as a spot on the F1-F2 plane, where the regions of vowels are shown in color. Preliminary use of these devices has shown that they complement each other to form a more effective system of speech training.", "authors": ["Minoru Shigenaga", "Yoshihiro Sekiguchi"], "n_citation": 0, "title": "Speech training systems using lateral shapes of vocal tract and F1-F2 diagram for hearing-impaired children", "venue": "international joint conference on artificial intelligence", "year": 1979, "id": "00ca027b-5174-40fa-bf63-9a97c2a5f518"},

    {"abstract": "Spatial encryption is a generic public-key cryptosystem where vectors play the role of public keys and secret keys are associated to affine spaces. Any secret key associated to a space can decrypt all ciphertexts encrypted for vectors in that space, and the delegation relation is defined by subspace inclusion. Though several constructions of spatial encryption schemes have been proposed in the literature, none of them are known to remain secure in the leakage-resilient setting, in which the adversary may be capable of learning limited additional information about the master secret key and other secret keys in the system. In this paper, we propose the first spatial encryption scheme achieving leakage resilience in the standard model, based on existing static assumptions over bilinear groups of composite order. Our new scheme is based on the leakageresilient HIBE scheme by Lewko, Rouselakis, and Waters in TCC 2011 and can be seen as a generalization of Moriyama-Doi spatial encryption scheme to the leakage-resilient setting.", "authors": ["Michel Abdalla", "Jill-J\u00eann Vie"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["3140c9ba-8d98-42a7-b6b8-c58fdaa8fe75", "4708b4d5-ddd8-48f7-ab7f-e14f925fbe62", "7432d716-a4ae-42f8-9dae-6599b6f3b475", "ad0777e4-aab4-41b1-928a-2844e2da585e", "b6aea9c9-30b3-4fcb-bf8f-adb19920c137", "c086c363-f6a2-475e-9ffa-23f3c5fffcf7", "f40ff3ec-979e-4f88-ab47-520879876fed", "fb9ea451-ad58-40da-be73-6e60b6607f8f"], "title": "Leakage-Resilient spatial encryption", "venue": "", "year": 2012, "id": "016a9a21-e882-4cda-a2b1-b2b46f10601e"},

The underlying data is imbalanced, as the number of benign cases significantly exceeds that of malignant ones, which will lead to problems for conventional pattern recognition algorithms. To address this, we propose an ensemble classifier system which is based on the idea of Clustering and Selection. The feature space, which is derived from a series of image symmetry features, is partitioned in order to decompose the problem into a set of simpler decision areas. We then delegate a locally competent classifier to each of the generated clusters. The set of predictors is composed of both standard models as well as models dedicated to imbalanced classification, so that we are able to employ a specialised classifier to clusters that show high class imbalance, while maintaining a high specificity for other clusters. We demonstrate that our method provides excellent classification performance and that it statistically outperforms several state-of-the-art ensembles dedicated to imbalanced problems.", "authors": ["Bartosz Krawczyk", "Gerald Schaefer", "Shao Ying Zhu"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["16f0341b-538d-40f3-996c-8de7cc4dc675", "1ca19102-96fb-4b4b-a469-88ad17f36b11", "38135245-8eff-4078-af6a-ea559ffa660b", "3cbd262f-bf3c-4fcd-a143-dd1a6be49e4b", "5355c319-b80d-40de-bf24-5ab2f95cb7b1", "64b37c52-2186-4398-ba45-5566f33642ce", "87b6c1da-c179-412e-8934-228784c9c82b", "9075487a-8183-4565-ac94-0197da31e056", "a6e178c8-d55f-460c-8e5b-c9d5cfb04c20", "af647f42-0b8d-480b-a36e-c7f351a95473", "b1e0b2d0-8a1e-42f5-8645-9fae30b8636f", "c52208d6-0dfb-400f-a19b-ed6fedfaea19", "e6b6e8f4-3c7d-4435-8ca9-192c3a76cdf8"], "title": "Breast Cancer Identification Based on Thermal Analysis and a Clustering and Selection Classification Ensemble", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "id": "0265aea8-65f3-4f46-b8b1-6b65bcb1d38f"},

    {"abstract": "The development of an automated system for the quality assessment of aerodrome ground lighting (AGL), in accordance with associated standards and recommendations, is presented. The system is composed of an image sensor, placed inside the cockpit of an aircraft to record images of the AGL during a normal descent to an aerodrome. A model-based methodology is used to ascertain the optimum match between a template of the AGL and the actual image data in order to calculate the position and orientation of the camera at the instant the image was acquired. The camera position and orientation data are used along with the pixel grey level for each imaged luminaire, to estimate a value for the luminous intensity of a given luminaire. This can then be compared with the expected brightness for that luminaire to ensure it is operating to the required standards. As such, a metric for the quality of the AGL pattern is determined. Experiments on real image data is presented to demonstrate the application and effectiveness of the system.", "authors": ["J. Niblock", "Jian-Xun Peng", "Karen McMenemy", "George W.

    {"abstract": "Quality specified image retrieval is helpful to improve the user experiences in mobile searching and social media sharing. However, the model for evaluating the quality of the user generated images, which are popular in social media sharing, remains unexploited. In this paper, we propose a scheme for quality assessment on user generated image. The scheme is formed by four attribute dimensions, including intrinsic quality, favorability, relevancy and accessibility of images. Each of the dimensions is defined and modeled to pool a final quality score of a user generated image. The proposed scheme can reveal the quality of user generated image in comprehensive manner. Experimental results show that the scores obtained by our scheme have high correlation coefficients with the benchmark data.

This approach is motivated by the desire to reduce the effort of providing data base-specific material for the front end, by the belief that a general analyser is well suited to the \"casual\" data base user, and by the assumption that the rich semantic apparatus used will be both adequate as a means of analysis and appropriate as a tool for linking the characterisations of input and data language items.

    {"abstract": "State-space explosion is a major obstacle in verification of time-critical distributed systems. An important factor with a negative influence on the tractability of the analysis is the size of constants that clocks are compared to. This problem is particularly accented in ex- plicit state-space exploration techniques. We suggest an approximation method for reducing the size of constants present in the model. The proposed method is developed for Timed-Arc Petri Nets and creates an under-approximation or an over-approximation of the model behaviour. The verification of approximated Petri net models can be considerably faster but it does not in general guarantee conclusive answers. We im- plement the algorithms within the open-source model checker TAPAAL and demonstrate on a number of experiments that our approximation techniques often result in a significant speed-up of the verification.", "authors": ["Sine Viesmose Birch", "Thomas Stig Jacobsen", "Jacob Jon Jensen", "Christoffer Moesgaard", "Niels N\u00f8rgaard Samuelsen", "Ji\u0159\u00ed Srba"], "n_citation": 2, "references": ["05187588-ada5-47d3-ab0d-a282be6fc447", "2230c340-e108-418b-a1ab-c40ef3eaefe5", "260b34ec-bd5e-487e-9e8a-b479dc679345", "26ba289c-7209-4d40-a7c3-3acc2bd88f65", "2a8da6cc-4c7e-480a-929b-d41ee021ccf4", "357c3e46-8be2-422d-b54f-74dbc52e0d3e", "4fccb3c3-45e6-46b9-8806-50d8451fb840", "50f10b22-b641-47ba-b594-d8af05f4c3d5", "80c5d053-0786-4d72-9cb8-a0a3217bd49e", "8512d397-7900-4842-81eb-8a7935a772df", "871abaad-e9bb-4f97-8dc5-081305d73bb9", "92d10f3d-c071-49d4-b9ee-b53151d80aa7", "9849d9c4-a97f-452f-882c-42a8c6cab0b5", "a02087e5-151c-4061-b172-7770f51f84f6", "b9406df7-db37-4dd8-83d9-90b6b1713f2d", "c45016d5-4794-4c33-a2d0-f7d30a38f9ef", "d196ebe5-517e-4423-a021-ec7206cad311", "d50cac03-25bc-47fd-9a27-2be1052bd5e9", "e2f00686-d81e-4d69-b5e3-88a9d8d2e7f9", "e67d1f2b-624c-424e-a4e0-7ba8ff810b14", "ecf23f31-b26e-45aa-8b56-674b89ef15f7", "ff3e5819-210a-4ada-b654-33a95105d77a"], "title": "Interval Abstraction Refinement for Model Checking of Timed-Arc Petri Nets", "venue": "formal modeling and analysis of timed systems", "year": 2014, "id": "03dd4db1-3540-4de6-b8f4-5d79cc538dd7"},

    {"abstract": "This paper presents an experimental evaluation of a rapid, adaptive assessment of the difference threshold (DL) of passive metacar- pophalangeal index finger joint flexion using a robotic device. Parameter Estimation by Sequential Testing (PEST) is compared to the method of constant stimuli (MOCS) using a two-alternative forced-choice par- adigm. The pilot study with 13 healthy subjects provided DLs within similar ranges for MOCS and PEST, averaging at 2.15 \u25e6 \u00b1 0.77 \u25e6 and 1.73 \u25e6 \u00b10.78 \u25e6 , respectively, in accordance with the literature. However, no significant correlation was found between the two methods (r(11) = 0.09, p =0 .762). The average number of trials required for PEST to converge was 58.7\u00b1 17.6, and significantly lower compared to 120 trials for MOCS ( p< 0.001), leading to an assessment time of under 15 min.

    {"abstract": "Entailment pairs are sentence pairs of a premise and a hypothesis, where the premise textually entails the hypothesis. Such sentence pairs are important for the development of Textual Entailment systems. In this paper, we take a closer look at a prominent strategy for their automatic acquisition from newspaper corpora, pairing first sentences of articles with their titles. We propose a simple logistic regression model that incorporates and extends this heuristic and investigate its robustness across three languages and three domains. We manage to identify two predictors which predict entailment pairs with a fairly high accuracy across all languages. However, we find that robustness across domains within a language is more difficult to achieve.", "authors": ["Manaal Faruqui", "Sebastian Pad\u00f3"], "n_citation": 3, "references": ["484d1994-e9da-477d-9be2-1f1e154cd919", "68453f24-4276-4d0c-b37e-19d23af549be", "71103b6f-e0a7-4eff-9759-b101db960813", "740934af-33dd-4725-9755-5905b5b2950b", "c3f183fc-1f5d-44a9-85c4-c81a03e89586", "c92afebe-c430-4bb8-9ef9-6a46981d2008", "f82b5743-01a4-45f3-bce7-b0ea605b77a1"], "title": "Acquiring entailment pairs across languages and domains: a data analysis", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "id": "05e535a9-2021-4393-a19e-6a0277034323"},

    {"abstract": "Resource tagging has become an integral and important feature in enabling community users to easily access relevant content in a timely manner. Various methods have been proposed and implemented to optimize the identification of and access to tags used to characterize resources across different types of social web-based communities. While these user-focused tagging methods have shown promise in their limited application, they do not transfer well to internal business applications where the cost, time, tagged content, and user resources needed to implement them is prohibitive. This paper provides a case study of the process, tools, and methods used to engage users in the development and management of a tag taxonomy (folksontology) used to characterize content in an internal technical support community in the Cisco Global Technology Center.", "authors": ["Donald M.
